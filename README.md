# neuromath
This program, Neuromath is a tool for mathematical analysis imaging. The program includes texture analysis and other features. 
This program builds on teh program Dvorah. At present the changes which include labelling for more body regions and new functionality have not been pushed off of my laptop onto GIT.
To run the program follow the same instructions as those for Dvorah, but listen to the port 9090
