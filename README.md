# neuromath
This program, Neuromath is a tool for mathematical analysis imaging. The program includes texture analysis and other features. 
This program builds on the program Debora. At present the changes which include labelling for more body regions and new functionality have not been pushed off of my laptop onto GitHub.
To run the program you need to have Anaconda (unless you happen to be running a Linux with a lot of Python libraries for scientific programming) and follow the similar instructions as those for Debora. 
Precise instruuctions will be posted on February 11th 2019.
